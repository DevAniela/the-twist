Have you been preparing and working hard to build a life you don't want, but you've ignored your inner guidance system for so long that you think you DO want it and that it's just supposed to be hard and unbearable?

Also, when you do decide to start doing what you want and going in the direction of your happiness, you get super confused and feel guilty, wrong and like a bad person. Because you are no longer following that familiar pattern, you feel like a bad person and think you are doing something wrong AGAIN, so you can no longer sleep at night and you feel like you won't be able to bear this feeling that's _devouring_ your sanity and your wellbeing.

This is an example post. There's another one [here](/posts/example-post).
