    For my first post, I would like to tell the story of what triggered a new process of self-reflection, culminating with a life-changing decision and hopefully a new, brighter beginning. Eventually, there will be a light at the end of the tunnel... I hope...

## A Purposefully Cryptic Intro to My Academic Pursuits

    My PhD. program was emotionally difficult for me. There were several years of hard work in a system that felt rigid and indifferent. My thesis topic was highly specialized, with limited academic literature to guide me.

    I initially thought _"This is great! I can just do my thing and it will be ok because I will be &lt;cue uplifting soundtrack&gt; an opener of roads, a pioneer; someone may actually read the published thing and find it useful!"_ Ok, maybe I was not THAT delusional. I did, however, genuinely think that everyone involved in the process would let me know if anything was not up to par, if I made a mistake, or if anything needed to be changed or added in. If I only knew how naive and sadly mistaken I was...

## How I Handled Hardship and How it Mattered Not

    My immense, almost uncontainable imposter syndrome made every new yearly rapport come with fresh daily emotional breakdowns for weeks on end. Until the day of the presentation came and, even though I would expect to be reprimanded for some reason, it always ended up with congratulatory positive feedback.

    I, of course, took this as a sign to bring a whole new level of paranoia into the mix. _"They're probably praising me out of pity... they just don't want to get involved because they have other more important things to do. They must have not even paid attention..."_ I found every excuse in the book to avoid acknowledging my worth or that I wrote something valuable, something I believed in. And I did believe.

    I somehow found a way to solve even the problems that were not my responsibility, and so took on other people's tasks (people who were much too busy with much more important things). Looking back, I navigated some treacherous waters and came out victorious. However, the final blow was to be saved for the end...

    I had done everything right. I made sure to fulfil all my obligations properly and punctually. I never refused anything and I felt all alone in the field I was actually researching. I had nothing to fall back on, no prior studies, except those from other, more developed countries, where mentalities are success-oriented and people are properly educated. I pushed through the tears, the discomfort, the feelings of abandonment etc. and finally reached the second-to-last presentation, which is a sort of formal rehearsal for the last one - the public one. I passed it with the usual praise and started to think _"Maybe I WAS good enough to pull this off. Maybe there WAS some truth in my abilities. Maybe I COULD do this right... right?"_

## The Awful Gift that Kept on Giving

WRONG! Cue a phone call one week before the final presentation was scheduled. All documents and expensive copies of the thesis had been submitted by this point and the rest was merely a formality. I was super-confident in what I was going to say, I had the slides ready to go.

_"You made a mistake throughout the entire thesis. You have to change the entire thing, reprint it and resubmit it all over again. This will take some months. And you have to pay for an extension."_

I felt that _time-is-standing-still_ feeling. That _I-want-to-say-something-so-that-I-don't-look-like-a-moron_ feeling. But my flabbers were completely and utterly ghasted. I would also not be defended in front of the doctoral school board of directors because apparently _"They don't cut anyone any slack."_

The tears I cried during my usual writing assignments, fuelled by my humongous imposter syndrome were mere babes, small little children, compared to the gigantism of the defeatedness I felt in this exceptional moment. It was all crashing down. And because miserable things love company, they kept on coming.

In short, I would be left penniless and the public presentation would be delayed. In the end, after fixing everything and somehow remaining mentally intact, I reached the final hurdle again and successfully delivered the public speech.

I tried to look on the bright side... to not throw the baby out with the bath water... but the damage had been done... repeatedly. I was now profoundly disappointed with the system and everyone who had the role of _guiding_ me throughout this process... So I did the single thing one could do under these circumstances. I took the possibly rash and maybe impulsive decision to stay forever away from the entire academic field.

Nowadays I have the ample delight of acquiring terrible anxiety whenever I have to do something even remotely related to it or to speak to someone who is part of it.

## Reflections and What-ifs

    I DO want to own up to the fact that I am at fault in various respects, even though I always kept my end of the bargain. I don't know how much this perception is my lack of confidence talking, but maybe I should have been more cutesy, more _kiss-ass-y_, more involved in making myself seen instead of simply doing my job and fulfilling my obligations on my own.

    I am aware my social skills may be somewhat lacklustre. Plus, I had horrible anxiety due to fear of authority and that lingering dreadful feeling of anticipation after every difficult thing I was asked to do in the past, that didn't align with my views.

    But that was then. Now there is the all too familiar _simultaneous-excitement-and-fear_ feeling, which is so hard to describe, despite its uniqueness. Then there are the occasional shifts from one perspective to another. The _I-love-Ross-I-hate-Ross_ mindset plagues me after having tried to detach from the initial field of suffering and despair to only fall into a seemingly manufactured boost of confidence, manifesting in an _I-shall-learn-programming-and-get-a-job-in-IT-so-that-I-become-financially-stable-and-never-have-to-rely-on-anyone-ever-again_ mentality.

    Turns out that learning to code by yourself, all while maintaining the _I-got-this_ attitude AND becoming good enough to get a real job is hard af on your own. So, as per the theme of this article, I decided I needed some guidance, some structure. This is how I enrolled in the university that would (hopefully) teach me, and it's also how this blog was born. I'll keep you posted.

    See you in the next one!
