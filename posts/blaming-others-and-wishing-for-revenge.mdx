Intro

## Incompetence at its Finest

To be honest, I am not a very capable person. I think this is the reason why few things made me more upset than incompetence. I kept suffering the second-hand effects of people taking on the responsibilities of those who didn't do their jobs properly. However, looking at the cold, hard truth, I can see now that I wanted to take shortcuts too. I wanted to get rid of this obligation, not make something amazing into which I pour the best intentions and energy I am capable of mustering. In hindsight, I presume that if I had done that, I would have felt more fulfilled.

## Judgement May Come Back to Haunt You

You never know someone's reality. When you start hating on someone for not doing their job properly or being stupid, incompetent or wrong, think about the fact that they may be experiencing something else that is affecting their life.

I have the tendency to judge others for making mistakes while simultaneously feeling entitled to people's understanding when I make mistakes or fail. Of course, on the inside, I beat myself up for all those things, so as to make every waking moment of my existence super hard and borderline unbearable.

## Communication is Key
